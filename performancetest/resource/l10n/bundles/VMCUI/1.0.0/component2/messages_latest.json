The service supports standard cluster sizes between 3 and 16 hosts, with up to 20 clusters per SDDC. Multi-AZ stretched clusters are also available to protect mission-critical applications. The hardware is configured with the latest VMware Cloud release of VMware vSphere. This release is compatible with the general releases of vSphere but optimized for use in large-scale cloud environments that are updated at a regular cadence to accommodate new capabilities and to protect against potential security vulnerabilities.",

Every host in the rack has one 10GbE connection to each switch and are configured with âactive/standbyâ teaming policies. There is also a dedicated management switch in the rack that is connected to the iDRAC ports on each server and to the applicable management ports for other devices, such as the smart PDUs. These connections offer out-of-band access if VMware engineers must troubleshoot unexpected crashes or other situations that cannot be resolved over the primary management network. During the ordering process, customers are asked to allocate two IP subnets that do not overlap or conflict with other networks in their enterprise. A /24 CIDR network is used for the SDDC management network â VMware ESXi, vSAN, and NSX-T connectivity. And for troubleshooting via direct console connections to the equipment, a /26 CIDR network is allocated for the out of band management network; this is used only by VMware engineers.",

The deployment technician installs either 1GbE SFP or 10GbE SFP+ fiber modules depending on requirements, offering an aggregate connection of up to 40Gbps if both ports on each switch are using the fastest link speed. The architecture between these environments is a routed, layer 3 (L3) topology and the load will be balanced through equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP). Therefore, the network devices on the data center side must be routers or switches with routing capabilities. For maximum availability we recommend connecting to two separate network devices. To enable IP connectivity across these connections, a point-to-point network is configured for each physical link by allocating /30 or /31 networks.",

Each rack includes VMware NSX-T which makes it very easy to create new workload network segments, to enable firewalling and micro-segmentation for enhanced application security, or to stretch existing layer 2 VLANs into the rack. Traffic from the existing enterprise data center network flows through a layer 3 boundary that can be controlled using existing routing and access lists procedures within an organization.
