Using a CloudFormation template, VMware Cloud on AWS creates an AWS Elastic Network Interface (ENI),\n    allowing your SDDC and services in the Amazon VPC and subnet in your AWS account to communicate without needing to\n    route traffic through the internet gateway. You can only connect an SDDC to a single Amazon VPC.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can view details of your connected Amazon VPC, such as the account ID, VPC ID, and subnet by clicking <b>Connected\n     VPC</b> in the <b>System</b> category on the <b>Networking & Security</b> tab.\n</p>\n",

You can access Direct Connect through a private virtual interface that you create\n    in the AWS console. In an SDDC with networking backed by NSX-T, all Direct Connect traffic, including vMotion,\n    management traffic, and compute gateway traffic, uses a private virtual interface.\n</p>\n",

    "what-is-traffic-group" : "<!--\ntitle: What is a Traffic Group?\ncontext: [networking, virtual-interfaces]\nfeature: uiEnableSddcGroups\n-->\n<p>\n    In the default configuration, your SDDC network has a single edge router through which all North-South traffic\n    flows. To provide additional bandwidth for a subset of this traffic, you can create one or more traffic groups, each\n    of which creates an additional edge router, then create a list of CIDR blocks that you want to have routed through\n    the new edge router. See <a href=\"https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/context?id=vmc_037\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n    >Add Traffic Groups to Increase Edge Bandwidth</a> for more information about creating and managing traffic groups.\n</p>\n",
