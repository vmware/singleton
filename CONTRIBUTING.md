## Contribute flow


### Setup CI Pipeline
Singleton use Travis-ci as CI framework and help contributor to test their code change as early as possible. Some configuration need to be done to setup CI pipeline in your fork repository.

##### SonarCloud Configuration
1. Generate Sonar Token

    a. After you fork the repositpry, login to 'sonarcloud.io' with your github account;
    
    b. My Account -> Security, generate a token and copy it, it will be used later.
    
2. Get Organization Key

    Go to 'My Organizations', mark down the key of your personal organization in right-up corner(not Organization name), it will be used in Travis CI configuration later.

##### Travis CI Configuration

1. After you configured SonarCloud, login to Travis-ci 'https://travis-ci.org' with your github account

2. Find your fork repository in your account settings, enabled it then click 'settings', add following environment variables
    
    SONAR_ORG=\<Organization key in SonarCloud configuration step2\>
    
    SONAR_TOKEN=\<token generated in SonarCloud\>
    
##### CI Pipeline Result

After you finished above configurations, you can commit and push code to your fork repository. It will trigger CI on Travis, you can login Travis to see result. You can login SonarCloud.io to see code scan details.

The sonar project and quality gate will be created automatically, project name should like: <SONAR_ORG>:\<sub-project name\>:\<branch>. Quality gate name should like: singleton:\<sub-project name\>-gate

#### Vulnerable Scan

We use Dependabot Preview(A Github APP owned by Github which provide dependencies scan) to do vulnerable scan
