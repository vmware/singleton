> Note:This sample application has been preconfigured to work with default Singleton service settings. Change the configurations in [i18nHandler.js](https://github.com/vmware/singleton/tree/g11n-js-client/samples/server/express/i18n/i18nHandler.js) as needed.

> Note:Language and Region can be changed by modifying the 'currentLanguage' and 'currentRegion' variables in  [i18nHandler.js](https://github.com/vmware/singleton/tree/g11n-js-client/samples/server/express/i18n/i18nHandler.js). Currently, only Chinese and English are supported in this sample application.
